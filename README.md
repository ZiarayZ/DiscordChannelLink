# DiscordChannelLink
A bot that links channels with the same name from different servers together. \n
You will need to edit the .env file yourself to use this python program. \n
Replace {blah_blah} with the data it tells, remove the {} as well. \n
\n
Then just run the runBot.py and it should automatically function.
