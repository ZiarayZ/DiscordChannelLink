# DiscordChannelLink
A bot that links channels with the same name from different servers together. <br />
You will need to edit the .env file yourself to use this python program. <br />
Replace {blah_blah} with the data it tells, remove the {} as well. <br />
<br />
Then just run the runBot.py and it should automatically function.
